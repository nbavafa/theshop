Run Instructions: Use a directory above the project directory
	Compile with javac thepirateshop/*.java
	Run with java thepirateshop/ThePirateShop


All the files within this folder were created by scratch by Nicholas Bavafa. ThePirateShop uses a ShoppingCart which holds CartItem objects (abstract class which is extended by DVD and Bluray). ThePirateShop implements Store which has the basic instructions on how to make a store. Most of the data is stored as ArrayLists. 

The following implementation of ThePirateShop is not web based. I tried for multiple days to learn the structure of .jsp and .xml files in order to make a web based store. Moreover, I tried multiple approaches on the web based project (Glassfish and Netbeans, Tomcat with JTSL, applets), but I just could not get the xml and jsp files correct. Hopefully my console based implementation of ThePirateShop demonstrates my understanding of abstract objects, data structures, and object oriented programming. 

If there is any tutorial or suggestion one may have at ClickTime for me to redo the project as a web based store, do not hesitate to email me with future instrucutions.
